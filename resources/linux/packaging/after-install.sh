# Why: register the bundled `veer` CLI on PATH at package-install time.
# The in-app "Install CLI" action (CliInstaller) can never run on a headless
# server, so without this symlink `veer serve` is unreachable from the shell on
# the exact hosts that need it most. deb/rpm both run this after unpacking.
#
# The shim resolves the real app by walking up from its own location, so a
# symlink works. We discover the install dir instead of hardcoding /opt/Orca
# because electron-builder's directory name can vary by productName sanitization.
